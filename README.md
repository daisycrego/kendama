# Kendamadex
Pokedex for kendama tricks
+ Daily tracker of tricks, with default lists, custom lists, and overall logging of tricks completed.

Add new tricks or select from a base library, put together routines (lists), and complete as often as desired. Lists include the # of times a trick is to be executed in the routine, which will allow for a simple frontend for each list (app).

Upload samples of tricks (videos) and descriptions.

I've put some additional thoughts into the wiki over in the repo: https://github.com/daisycrego/kendama/wiki.
